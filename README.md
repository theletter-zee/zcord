A basic concept chat-app.


I made a Discord themed chatApp before in the past which I was a bit proud of but I ended up losing all the files for that so I decided to recreate it but this time I used a [Youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9DkvcT27WI) to speed up the process. This was mainly to get a basic feel for what making apps in c# is like, maybe in the future I'll make something out of this.
